### 👋 Hey there!

Welcome to my **Today I Learned (TIL)** journal   
a space where I write down things I’ve learned, one day at a time.  
This is a personal learning log by [@irfnrdh](https://github.com/irfnrdh/til), where I try to capture ideas, insights, tools,   
and little discoveries I come across while working, building, or just exploring.

> Everything is connected. I’m just following the threads.


### Why I'm doing this

- To help myself remember what I learn  
- To share things that might help someone else  
- To stay consistent with daily writing  
- And mostly to learn in public, no pressure


### Just a heads-up

These notes are personal, unpolished, and sometimes incomplete.  
They’re not meant to be perfect guides — just snapshots of what I’ve picked up.  
Always double-check things if you’re using them for anything serious.


### About me (the person behind all this)

- 📍 I live in Aceh, Indonesia  
- 🛠️ I love tinkering with web dev, AI tools, indie hacking, and cybersecurity  
- 🧠 I enjoy making things, breaking things, and figuring out how they work  
- 🐧 Most of the time, you’ll find me in a terminal or writing something weird


Thanks for dropping by 🙏  
If you’ve got ideas, thoughts, or just wanna say hi   
feel free to reach out!
