## 👋 About This TIL

**TIL (Today I Learned)** is my personal learning log, [@irfnrdh](https://github.com/irfnrdh/til), where I document things I learn each day.  
All entries are rewritten in my own words, often as a result of hands-on exploration in tech, AI, programming, and other topics I find interesting.

> Everything is connected.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Help me retain what I learn
- Serve as an open reference for others who may need quick insights
- Build a daily habit of note-taking and sharing
- Practice *Learning in Public*

## 📌 Disclaimer

> All notes are written from a personal perspective.  
> They may not be complete or 100% accurate.  
> Please refer to official sources if you need more in-depth information.
